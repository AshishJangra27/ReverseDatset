# ReverseDatset
This program is to reverse the text file or a dataset upside down.

Her we change the file name of the dataset csv file and the destiny dataset file name with csv or txt extension where the reversed dataset is going to be stored.

In our program, the original dataset file is NSE-TCS.csv and the reversed or upside down dataset is stored in Rev.csv.
